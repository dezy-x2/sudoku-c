# sudoku-c


#### Description
This is a mimic of a project that I made in typescript first. I'm making this because I blanked on a project to make and I wanted to see how much the speed could be increased C instead of TS.
#### Current Status
Yea I need to fix the puzzle generator rn cause I totally blanked on the fact that sudoku has rules and it currently generates puzzles that are not valid. lol.
